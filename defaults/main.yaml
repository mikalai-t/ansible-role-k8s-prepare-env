  # Variables precedence (since Ansible version 2.x):
  # (*) - role defaults [Tasks defined outside of a role will see the last role’s defaults.]
  #     - inventory file or script group vars [Variables defined in inventory file or provided by dynamic inventory.]
  #     - inventory group_vars/all
  #     - playbook group_vars/all
  #     - inventory group_vars/*
  #     - playbook group_vars/*
  #     - inventory file or script host vars [Variables defined in inventory file or provided by dynamic inventory.]
  #     - inventory host_vars/*
  #     - playbook host_vars/*
  #     - host facts / cached set_facts [When created with set_facts’s cacheable option, variables will have the high
  #                                      precedence in the play, but will be the same as a host facts precedence when
  #                                      they come from the cache.]
  #     - inventory host_vars/*
  #     - playbook host_vars/*
  #     - host facts
  #     - play vars
  #     - play vars_prompt
  #     - play vars_files
  #     - role vars (defined in role/vars/main.yml)
  #     - block vars (only for tasks in block)
  #     - task vars (only for the task)
  #     - include_vars
  #     - set_facts / registered vars
  #     - role (and include_role) params
  #     - include params
  #     - extra vars (always win precedence)
